# Stock-Market-Prediction
The main aim of this system is to provide a general idea of where the stock market is headed. It is only limited to a very basic prediction model. Thus, it cannot be used as a critical decision making tool. By incorporating only limited number of parameters, there is certain degree of accuracy. Since, there are many indeterminate parameters that directly affect stock market, each and every one of them cannot be taken into account. So, our model only depends on the relationship of our selected parameters with the share price. 
At present, this system only performs analysis and prediction of hydropower sector companies of Nepal This system is limited to only certain users that have knowledge of stock market.
